# Robustness of Deep Neural Networks

Deep neural networks (DNN) are to be notoriously brittle to small perturbations in their input data. Like the picture below, an image classification model, even with 99% accuracy on its testing dataset, could misclassify the input variations generated by simple spatial transformation (e.g., rotation). This is the concept of "Robustness of Deep Neural Networks".

## Approach

Recent studies showed that we can increase the robustness of DNN models by applying natural variations to the dataset. However, applying all-natural variations to the input data costs too much time. Therefore we used a genetic algorithm to generate the most suitable variant of the input data. In addition, we propose various genetic algorithms with three different selection methods in a genetic algorithm and test their performances. This approach originally comes from https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gaoxiang/papers/Sensei_ICSE20.pdf.

## Usage

The experiments can be conducted with the following command and all the experiment configurations are handled by config file (check `configs/`).

```
python main.py configs/{config_file}.json
```

Agent is chosen from the config file in the argument and corresponding agent's `run()` procedure is called.
After `run()` procedure is done, agent's `finalize()` procedure is called.
